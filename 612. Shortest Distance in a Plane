Table: Point2D

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
+-------------+------+
(x, y) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the position of a point on the X-Y plane.
 

The distance between two points p1(x1, y1) and p2(x2, y2) is sqrt((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2).

Write an SQL query to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point2D table. Round the distance to two decimal points.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Point2D table:
+----+----+
| x  | y  |
+----+----+
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
+----+----+
Output: 
+----------+
| shortest |
+----------+
| 1.00     |
+----------+
Explanation: The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1, -1) to (-1, 2).




# Write your MySQL query statement below

select 
    round(sqrt(min(pow(b.x-a.x,2)+pow(b.y-a.y,2))) ,2) as shortest
from Point2d a
join Point2d b
    on a.x!=b.x 
    or a.y!=b.y
    
    
    
select min(round(sqrt(power(t1.x-t2.x,2) + power(t1.y-t2.y,2)),2)) shortest
from point_2d t1
cross join point_2d t2
on !(t1.x = t2.x and t1.y=t2.y)
