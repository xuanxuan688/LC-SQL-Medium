Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.



# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- answer1
select distinct l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
from logs l1, logs l2, logs l3
where l1.id=l2.id-1 and l2.id=l3.id-1
and l1.num=l2.num and l2.num=l3.num


-- answer2
SELECT
    Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l
WHERE
    Num = (SELECT Num FROM logs WHERE Id = l.Id - 1)
    And Num = (SELECT Num FROM logs WHERE Id = l.Id + 1)
