Table: Accounts

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.
 

Table: Logins

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
 

Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for five or more consecutive days.

Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.

Return the result table ordered by id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Explanation: 
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
 

Follow up: Could you write a general solution if the active users are those who logged in to their accounts for n or more consecutive days?

-- datediff(l1, l2) between 1 and n-1
   having count(distinct l2.date)>=n-1


# Write your MySQL query statement below

select distinct l1.id,
(select name from Accounts where id=l1.id) name
from Logins l1
join Logins l2
    on l1.id=l2.id 
    and datediff(l1.login_Date, l2.login_date) between 1 and 4
group by l1.id, l1.login_date
having count(distinct l2.login_date)>=4
order by l1.id



This is a classic problem of find consecutive data.

select distinct a.id, a.name
from Logins l1 join Logins l2
on l1.id = l2.id and datediff(l2.login_date, l1.login_date) between 0 and 4
join Accounts a
on l1.id = a.id
group by l1.id, l1.login_date
having count(distinct l2.login_date) = 5
Approach Breakdown:

Start with Join
Whenever, we are faced with "finding some consecutives":, the first approach that could fit in is using Joins.
For this problem, take a Logins row l1,
Since, we are tasked to find consecutive days (Logins row l2) after l1.login_date
To achieve so, we should do join between Logins l1 and Logins l2

Filtering out 5 consecutives
Focus on finding only 5 consecutives days.
Starting from l1.login_date, we should look for dates in ranges (l1.login_date + 0, l2.login_date + 4)
To determine if the above l2.login_date are consecutive, filter with count(distinct l2.login_date) which should be 5 (since we need all the 5 days)
