Table: Logs

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
log_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.
 

Write an SQL query to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in the table Logs.

Return the result table ordered by start_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+
| start_id   | end_id       |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
| 10         | 10           |
+------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
The result table should contain all ranges in table Logs.
From 1 to 3 is contained in the table.
From 4 to 6 is missing in the table
From 7 to 8 is contained in the table.
Number 9 is missing from the table.
Number 10 is contained in the table.




# Write your MySQL query statement below

select min(log_id) as start_id, 
    max(log_id) as end_id
from (select log_id, rank() over (order by log_id)  rnk from Logs) t
group by log_id-rnk



select L1.log_id as START_ID, min(L2.log_id) as END_ID
from 
	(select log_id from Logs 
	where log_id-1 not in (select log_id from Logs)) L1,
	(select log_id from Logs 
	where log_id+1 not in (select log_id from Logs)) L2
where L1.log_id <= L2.log_id
group by L1.log_id
